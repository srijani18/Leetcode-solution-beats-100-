Problem Statement: Implement Stack using Queue

Intuition

A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle — the last element inserted should be the first one to be removed.
On the other hand, a queue follows First In First Out (FIFO) order — the first inserted element is the first to come out.

So, to implement a stack using only a queue, we need to somehow reverse the natural order of the queue after every insertion.
The main idea is:
When we push a new element, it should appear at the front of the queue so that when we pop, it comes out first — just like the top of a stack.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Approach

We use a single queue and perform a clever rotation during each push() operation.

Push(x)

Add the new element x to the queue.

Then, rotate all previously inserted elements behind it by removing them one by one from the front and pushing them to the back.

This ensures that the most recently added element (x) is now at the front of the queue, effectively acting as the top of the stack.

Example:

Push(10): [10]

Push(20): push 20 → [10, 20], rotate → [20, 10]

Push(30): push 30 → [20, 10, 30], rotate → [30, 20, 10]

Pop()

Simply remove and return the front element of the queue (which represents the stack’s top).

Top()

Return the front element of the queue without removing it.

Empty()

Return true if the queue is empty.


| Operation | Time Complexity                                 | Space Complexity                      |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `push()`  | **O(n)** — due to rotation of existing elements | **O(n)** — for storing stack elements |
| `pop()`   | **O(1)**                                        | **O(n)**                              |
| `top()`   | **O(1)**                                        | **O(n)**                              |
| `empty()` | **O(1)**                                        | **O(1)**                              |
