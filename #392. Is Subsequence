Problem Statement:
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

#Solution by Srijani Guha Ray

Approach:
Two-pointer technique ‚Äî move through both strings, matching characters from s within t while maintaining order.

Intuition:
A subsequence is formed by deleting some (or no) characters from t without changing the order of the remaining ones.

Complexity:

‚è±Ô∏è Time: O(|t|)

üíæ Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.size() && j < t.size()) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) {
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return i == s.size();
    }
};
